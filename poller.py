ubxpoller.py

This example illustrates how to read, write and display UBX messages
concurrently using threads and queues. This represents a useful
generic pattern for many end user applications.

It implements three threads which run concurrently:
1) a read thread which continuously reads UBX data from the receiver.
2) a write thread which sends UBX commands or polls to the receiver.
3) a display thread which displays parsed UBX data at the terminal.
UBX data is passed between threads using queues.

Press CTRL-C to terminate.

FYI: Since Python implements a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL),
threads are not strictly concurrent, though this is of minor
practical consequence here. True concurrency could be
achieved using multiprocessing (i.e. separate interpreter
processes rather than threads) but this is non-trivial in
this context as serial streams cannot be shared between
processes. A discrete hardware I/O process must be implemented
e.g. using RPC server techniques.
